		<h4 class="text-center" style="font-size: 1.5em;">My name is Josh and I'm from Pittsburgh. I started this web app as my final project while attending the Ironhack web development bootcamp in Miami to make your life easier. As a northerner who both craved knowledge and travel, the urge to go to a bootcamp grew stronger. While I was absolutely ready mentally and monetarily, finding affordable short term housing almost proved to a be hurdle too great, nearly cutting my bootcamp experience short before it even started. This is a problem that hit close to home, and I want others to have the great learning or career experiences while traveling as I did. </h4>
